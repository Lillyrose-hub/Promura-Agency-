## 🔧 CURRENT CONFIGURATION

### Server Status
- **Running on**: http://localhost:8000 (port 8000, not 5000!)
- **Mode**: DRY RUN (Safe testing mode)
- **Account**: purplefan420 (connected but not authenticated)
- **Background Processes**: Multiple server instances running (need cleanup)

### OnlySnarf Integration
- **Status**: Connected but authentication failing
- **Error**: "Inappropriate ioctl for device" - terminal issue
- **Mode**: dry_run = True (simulates posts without actually posting)

### Known Issues to Fix
1. **Logger Methods**: Fixed `log_event` → `log`, `log_error` → `error`
2. **Multiple Server Instances**: Kill old processes before starting new ones
3. **Authentication**: Need real OnlyFans credentials for production

---

## 📋 NEXT SESSION GOALS

### Priority 1: Real Account Testing
```python
# Current status in onlysnarf_client.py:
self.dry_run = True  # Change to False for real posting
self.authenticated = False  # Need real auth
```

### Priority 2: Authentication Setup
- Configure actual OnlyFans credentials
- Set up proper authentication flow
- Test with real purplefan420 account
- Validate posting to OnlyFans

### Priority 3: Multi-Account Support
- Add additional OnlyFans accounts
- Test model selection system
- Implement bulk posting
- Verify scheduling across accounts

### Priority 4: Production Deployment
- Switch from dry-run to production mode
- Set up scheduling daemon
- Configure automatic posting
- Monitor real post performance

---

## 🧪 TEST RESULTS

### Validation Tests (test_real_post.py)
✅ Immediate Post: PASSED
✅ Scheduled Post: PASSED
✅ Post with Media: PASSED
- System correctly simulates posts in dry-run mode
- Queue and history tracking working

### Library Tests (test_library_post.py)
❌ Library Upload: FAILED (logger issue - now fixed)
- Need to retest after fixes
- Mixed media workflow ready but untested

---

## 💡 IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Virtual Environment**: Always activate before running
   ```bash
   cd /root/onlysnarf-dashboard
   source dashboard_env/bin/activate
   cd app
   ```

2. **Server Management**:
   - Check running processes: `ps aux | grep python`
   - Kill old servers before starting new ones
   - Server runs on port 8000

3. **CSS Variables** (for future customization):
   ```css
   --accent-primary: #FFDEE2;  /* Soft pink */
   --bg-primary: #0a0a0f;      /* Deep black */
   --bg-secondary: #151520;    /* Dark gray */
   ```

4. **Library API Endpoints**:
   - GET `/api/library` - Get all media
   - POST `/api/library/upload` - Upload new media
   - POST `/api/library/{id}/use` - Track usage
   - DELETE `/api/library/{id}` - Remove media
   - GET `/api/library/stats` - Get statistics

5. **Mixed Media Posting**:
   - Form includes `library_media_ids` (JSON array)
   - Backend combines library + new uploads
   - Tracks usage for each library item used

---

## 🚀 QUICK START (Next Session)

1. **Start Server**:
   ```bash
   cd /root/onlysnarf-dashboard
   source dashboard_env/bin/activate
   cd app
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Access Dashboard**: http://localhost:8000

3. **Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   python test_real_post.py      # Basic validation
   python test_library_post.py   # Library workflow
   ```

4. **Check Logs**:
   - Server logs: Check terminal output
   - Metrics: http://localhost:8000/metrics
   - Queue: http://localhost:8000/queue
